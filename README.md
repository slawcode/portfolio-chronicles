## Description
- This is my portfolio using React. The motivation for this application was to utilize my new React skills, to further hone them, and set me apart from other developers. Furthermore, this application will showcase my web development skills to future employers. 
- Many challenges arose with this project to correctly implement a functioning React application while meeting the project requirements.  
- The project was very overwhelming at first and time was an issue, as with many assignments. I made many attempts at my React portfolio and finally began seeing functonaity with this project. 
- Also, at first I had trouble creating a downloadable link to my resume and was overthinking how to do so. However, this was easily resolved with very simple code.
- I learned a lot about React through this project, including setting up a React application, the file structure and the routes. I am excited to continue to practice with React and grow my development skills. 
- Future development for this application will be continued practice with React to greatly enhance the styling while keeping my portfolio unqiue to set me apart from other developers, expecially during my job search.
