                Hello! My nsame is Sheryl and I am currently attending the University of Toronto's part-time coding bootcamp and in my last week!!! I decided to try coding because I love learning and yearned for a technicial skill, specifically one I could shocase. I am excited to further tweak my skills after the bootcamp ends, after receiving a foundational base in the development world.
